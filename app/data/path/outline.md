# Learning path outline

The plan for all 13 stages: which concepts each stage introduces, and where each concept comes back.
Write a stage's cards from this plan, then update the plan if the stage turned out differently.

Rules (from `NEXT_STEPS.md`): every concept is introduced once and comes back at least twice, each time in a new form (another case, a diagram, a comparison with something learned since, a harder twist). Typical gaps: ~20 cards, then the next stage or two, then a late stage.

Stages are 35–90 cards. Shorter is fine: depth comes from comebacks, not from stage length.

## Every concept: introduced → comebacks

## Stage 3 detail: Data, what we protect

Arc: you can't protect what you don't know you have → who owns it → how sensitive it is → where it lives and moves → what it goes through in its life → how to make it unreadable when it must leave → how to get rid of it.

1. Marriott/Starwood story (unknown inherited database) → inventory, owner, classification
2. Classification levels, government vs commercial, labels, who decides (owner, not IT)
3. Data roles: owner, custodian, steward, user; GDPR controller, processor, subject (comeback d1-c4)
4. Three states (at rest, in transit, in use) with CIA per state (comeback d1-c1), picture
5. Lifecycle: create → store → use → share → archive → destroy, picture
6. Baselines, scoping, tailoring; DLP, CASB, DRM; tokenization, masking, pseudonymization vs anonymization
7. Retention and legal hold, EOL vs EOS, data residency
8. Remanence: Morgan Stanley's unwiped drives, clear/purge/destroy, SSDs and degaussing, crypto-shredding
9. Recap
